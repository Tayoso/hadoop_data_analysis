	Download all files individually to /home/training/
	on local filesystem
	and run

if it does not work try...

	1. Download all the files in the
	zip to /home/training/ on local filesystem
	and run 0_unzip_gz.sh using 

. /home/training/0_unzip_gz.sh

	2. Data loading and cleaning 
. /home/training/alpha/mysql/mysql.sh

	3. Impala answers and Data visualization 
. /home/training/alpha/impala/run_1.sh

	4. Hive answers 
. /home/training/alpha/hive/run_2.sh

	5. Pyspark answers 
. /home/training/alpha/pyspark/sparkprogram.sh
